# Algorithm Analysis
I am a note that belongs to multiple worlds!

## Why am I here?
In the Abstract View, you will find me nested under:
1. `Learning Paths` > `Computer Science`
2. `Learning Paths` > `Mathematics`

## How it works
My frontmatter looks like this:
```yaml
parent: ["[[Computer Science]]", "[[Mathematics]]"]
```

This "Poly-Hierarchy" allows you to organize knowledge non-linearly, exactly how the brain works.
